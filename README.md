# StickJumpHTML5
 
<p>HTML5 Version of my Stick Jump game. Link: https://paaooo.github.io/StickJumpHTML5/</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
Clicking Exit will not work since it's intended for an application.
<br>The game saves position when you either click restart or click menu when you pause since it's intended for an application.</p>
<p>
Original App version found here:
